<h1>Data File Format</h1>
<p>
  The Bovine LIMS accepts data files containing metabolite concentrations in CSV format. The format is a metabolite on each line, with the accompanying concentration. This is depicted in the following table:<br /><br />
<table border=1>
  <tr><td>urea</td><td>3.45</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1-methylhistidine</td><td>435.67</td></tr>
  <tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
  <tr><td>creatinine</td><td>33.45</td></tr>
</table>
<br /><br />
Make sure not to put headers in the data file, since these will be interpreted as metabolites.
