Studies allow users to analyze samples at a phenotypic level. <%= SUBJECT_CONFIG[:title] %> cohorts are added to the study, and associated with <em>labels</em> (i.e. phenotypic conditions of interest). This allows the export of <%= SUBJECT_CONFIG[:name].pluralize %> and directed analysis with respect to the labels.
